## Overview of the `main` Function

The `main` function orchestrates the web scraping process by following these steps:

1. **Fetch the Main Page**: It retrieves the main page that lists all completed UFC events using the `get_page_content` function.

2. **Parse Events**: It loops through the event elements (links to individual events) on the main page. For each event:
   - The `extract_event_info` function is called to gather the event's basic details (name, date, location) and to parse the event page.
   
3. **Parse Fights**: For each event, it retrieves the list of fights:
   - The `extract_fight_info` function extracts basic fight data such as fight link, winner, and fighter details from the event's fight table.
   - This information is added to the `fights` list in the event's dictionary.

4. **Scrape Detailed Fight and Fighter Information**: Once basic fight details are collected:
   - The `scrape_fight_info` function is called to scrape detailed fight data, such as round-by-round stats, methods of victory, and more.
   - The `scrape_fighter_info` function scrapes additional details for each fighter, including height, reach, and date of birth.

5. **Store Events**: The completed event (with detailed fight data) is added to the `events_list`.

6. **Write to CSV**: After processing all events and fights, the `write_to_csv` function is called to save the results into a CSV file.

7. **Error Handling**: The function includes basic error handling to ensure that if an error occurs, the data collected so far is still written to the CSV.

By the end of the `main` function, a detailed list of events and fight data is collected and written to a CSV file.
