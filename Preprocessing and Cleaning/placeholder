Now that we have scraped and compiled a comprehensive archival dataset, which includes every event, fight, round statitic, etc, it's time to preprocess and clean the data.
Our model will seek to predict the outcome a three round (non-title) fight, fought in the mens division, based on the in-round fighter statitics of the first two rounds.
We exclude womens fights and title fights because of the limited sample size. The vast majority of fights are in the mens division, and of those, only a handful are title fights (5 rounds).
Since our model relies on a complete set of in-round statistics (round 1 and 2), we drop fights that do not make it past the second round.
The sport has changed so much since it's inception, it seemed appropriate to look at only the past 10 years of data.
Rather than include in-round statistics for each fighter, we calculate disparities between performance metrics.
Three fight statistics (total strikes landed, significant strikes attempted, significant strikes to the head) were not included in the model because of 
multicollinearity.
Reversals, distance strikes, clinch strikes, and ground strikes are all excluded from out model as well, as ESPN does not publish them in real-time.
